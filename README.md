# AI based Assistant

This is an AI assistant that uses Graphical chatting interface to interact with the user. The model used for the purpose is https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B, which seems to perform very well by leveraging Tinygrad. The GUI was done using pygame, and uses a bunch of free-to-use fonts(which I found from all over the internet).

Though black and white, the UI allows seamless conversations between the user and the assistant.
